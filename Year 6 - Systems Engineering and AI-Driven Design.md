#### **Year 6 STEAM Curriculum: Systems Engineering and AI-Driven Design** üöÄ
#### **Curriculum Summary** üåü
This 15-class STEAM program is designed for Year 6 students, aligning with the Cambridge Lower Secondary framework. It focuses on the NGSS standard **MS-ETS1-1**: "Define the criteria and constraints of a design problem with sufficient precision to ensure a successful solution, taking into account relevant scientific principles and potential impacts on people and the natural environment that may limit possible solutions". Each 90-minute class includes a 60-minute main lesson and a 30-minute hands-on extension, structured using the 5E instructional model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate) to enhance student engagement and problem-solving skills.

Students will utilize laptops for more advanced coding in **Python**, alongside block-based platforms for complex prototyping. The curriculum deepens their understanding of robotics, 3D design, and digital systems, while introducing more sophisticated AI concepts and data management practices. This program aims to develop precise problem-definition skills and an awareness of the broader impacts of technology, preparing students to tackle complex, real-world engineering challenges.
