##### **Year 8 STEAM Curriculum: Hybrid Design and AI-Driven Optimization** üöÄ

###### **Curriculum Summary** üåü

This 15-class STEAM program is designed for Year 8 students, aligning with the Cambridge Lower Secondary framework and advancing their skills in Python, AI, and systems engineering. The curriculum is centered on the NGSS standard **MS-ETS1-3**: **"Analyze data from tests to determine similarities and differences among several design solutions to identify the best characteristics of each that can be combined into a new solution to better meet the criteria for success"**. Each 90-minute class is structured with a 60-minute main lesson and a 30-minute hands-on extension, utilizing the 5E instructional model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate) to foster deep learning and engagement.

Students will deepen their understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), use version control for genuine team collaboration, and move from evaluating competing solutions to creating innovative **hybrid designs**. They will analyze test data to identify the best features from different prototypes and combine them into a single, optimized solution. The curriculum also introduces more advanced AI concepts, including training simple neural networks and understanding their real-world applications and limitations.

##### **Unit 1: Collaborative Development and Advanced Data Handling (Classes 1-3)** üíª

###### **Class 1: Inheritance and Polymorphism in Python** üß©

*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: Show students different types of robots (e.g., a wheeled rover, a walking robot, a drone) that all share common functions like "move" and "report status" but implement them differently. Ask: "How can we efficiently code a family of related but distinct robots?".
    *   **Explore**: Students will create a parent `Robot` class in Python, then create child classes like `WheeledRobot` and `WalkingRobot` that **inherit** from the parent. They will override the `move()` method in each child class to reflect its unique form of movement.
    *   **Explain**: Introduce the OOP concepts of **Inheritance** (allowing a new class to take on the properties of an existing one) and **Polymorphism** (allowing different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways). Explain how this helps create scalable and organized code for complex systems.
    *   **Elaborate**: Students create a program that manages a list containing objects of different robot types and calls the `move()` method on each, observing how polymorphism works in practice.
    *   **Evaluate**: Provide formative feedback on students' code, assessing their ability to correctly implement inheritance and override methods to create specialized child classes.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Students apply their code to control two physically different robots (if available) or two simulated robots with distinct movement styles. They will use a single loop to command both, demonstrating the power of polymorphism in hardware control.

###### **Class 2: Managing Data with Files and Basic Data Analysis** üåê

*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: Ask: "When you run a test on a robot, how can you save the results so you can analyze them later, even after the program closes?".
    *   **Explore**: Students write a Python script that collects sensor data (e.g., simulated distance readings) and saves it to a text file. They then write a separate script that reads the data from the file and calculates simple statistics like the average and maximum values.
    *   **Explain**: Explain the importance of **file I/O (Input/Output)** for data persistence, logging, and analysis. Discuss how analyzing data collected from tests is crucial for making evidence-based engineering decisions, directly linking to **MS-ETS1-3**.
    *   **Elaborate**: Students run a robot through a test course, log its sensor data to a file, and then use a data analysis script to generate a summary report of its performance.
    *   **Evaluate**: Review students' code and the data reports they generate, assessing their ability to save, read, and perform basic analysis on collected data.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Students run two different robot prototypes through the same course, saving the performance data for each to separate files. They then write a single analysis program to compare the key metrics (e.g., average speed, consistency) from both files, setting the stage for data-driven comparison.

###### **Class 3: Practical Version Control with a GitHub Workflow** üßä

*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: Present a more advanced collaboration scenario: "A team needs to work on different parts of the same software simultaneously. How do professional software teams manage this without creating chaos?".
    *   **Explore**: Introduce a simplified, practical Git workflow. In pairs, students will "clone" a starting repository, each create a new "branch" to work on a separate feature, "commit" their changes, and then "merge" their branches back into the main codebase.
    *   **Explain**: Explain the core concepts of **branching** (working on changes in isolation) and **merging** (combining changes back together) in version control systems like Git. Emphasize that this is the standard for collaborative software and hardware projects in industry.
    *   **Elaborate**: Students use this branching workflow to collaboratively develop a Python program for their robot, with one student adding a movement feature while the other adds a sensor-reading feature. They then merge their work to create a single, unified program.
    *   **Evaluate**: Observe the students' collaboration and their ability to follow the branching and merging workflow, providing feedback on resolving any simple "merge conflicts" that arise.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Teams use their newly merged code to control a physical robot. This tangible result reinforces the success of their collaborative workflow, demonstrating how separate features developed in parallel can be integrated into a functional whole.

##### **Unit 2: Hybrid Design through Data-Driven Analysis (Classes 4-7)** ü§ñ

###### **Class 4: Analyzing Test Data from Competing Designs (MS-ETS1-3 Focus)** üéØ

*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: Revisit the previous year's focus on choosing one solution over another. Pose a new question: "What if the best solution isn't Solution A or Solution B, but a combination of the best parts of both?".
    *   **Explore**: Students are given datasets from tests of two different robot designs meant to solve the same problem (e.g., Design A is fast but inaccurate, Design B is slow but precise). Using Python, they will analyze this data to identify specific, measurable similarities and differences.
    *   **Explain**: Formally introduce **MS-ETS1-3**. Explain that the goal is to move beyond simply choosing a winner and instead analyze test data to identify the **best characteristics** of *each* design. Discuss how to break down a solution into key components (e.g., chassis, gripper, algorithm) for analysis.
    *   **Elaborate**: Groups create a "Comparative Analysis Report" where they use data visualizations (e.g., simple charts) and statistics to compare the performance of the two designs. They must explicitly list the strengths of each design supported by the data.
    *   **Evaluate**: Assess the analysis reports for their use of data to draw clear conclusions about the similarities, differences, and specific strengths of each competing design.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Students run live tests of two distinct physical robot prototypes (e.g., one with a claw, one with a scoop) and collect their own data. This hands-on data collection reinforces the connection between physical performance and the datasets they are analyzing.

###### **Class 5: Designing a Hybrid Software Solution** üìä

*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: "Based on our data, Algorithm A is great for finding the target quickly, but Algorithm B is better for precise final movements. How can we get the best of both?"
    *   **Explore**: Students analyze two different Python algorithms for robot navigation. They will identify the most effective parts of each algorithm based on test data (e.g., one part for speed, one for accuracy).
    *   **Explain**: Discuss the concept of a **hybrid algorithm**, where developers combine the best components of different approaches to create a superior new solution. This directly applies the "combine the best characteristics" aspect of **MS-ETS1-3** to software design.
    *   **Elaborate**: Students write a new, hybrid Python script that integrates the most effective code blocks from both of the original algorithms. For example, using the fast search method from Algorithm A and the precise alignment method from Algorithm B.
    *   **Evaluate**: Review the students' new hybrid code, providing feedback on how well they integrated the components and the logic behind their design choices.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Students test their new hybrid algorithm on a robot and compare its performance against both of the original algorithms. They collect data to prove that their new solution is superior to either of the individual parent solutions.

###### **Class 6: Prototyping a Hybrid Physical Design** üìà

*   **Main Class (60 min):**

    *   **Explore**: Based on their analysis from Class 4, groups identify the best physical components from two different robot prototypes (e.g., the fast chassis from Robot A and the strong gripper from Robot B). They will then sketch a new, hybrid robot that combines these parts.
    *   **Explain**: Explain that **hybrid engineering** is a common practice for creating optimized solutions. Discuss how 3D modeling and printing are essential tools for creating custom parts needed to integrate components from different designs.
    *   **Elaborate**: Groups use 3D design software to create a model of their new hybrid robot. This may involve modifying existing part designs or creating new adapter pieces to make the best components from each prototype fit together.
    *   **Evaluate**: Assess the students' 3D models for the thoughtful integration of the selected "best characteristics" into a coherent and functional new design.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Groups begin 3D printing the key components of their new hybrid design. This session focuses on preparing the physical parts for assembly in a later class.

###### **Class 7: Justifying the New, Combined Solution** üêç

*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: "You've built a new hybrid design. Now, you must prove to a manager‚Äîusing data‚Äîwhy your combined solution is better than any of the original options.".
    *   **Explore**: Groups assemble their new hybrid robot and test its performance. They collect the same performance data they gathered for the original designs in Class 4.
    *   **Explain**: Reiterate **MS-ETS1-3**. Explain that the final step in this process is to produce a final analysis that uses data to demonstrate how the new, combined solution better meets the criteria for success than any of the original competing designs.
    *   **Elaborate**: Each group prepares a "Hybrid Design Justification" presentation. They must present the data from all three designs (A, B, and their hybrid) side-by-side to clearly and quantitatively justify why their new creation is the optimal solution.
    *   **Evaluate**: Assess the justification presentations for a convincing, data-driven argument that their hybrid solution successfully incorporates the best characteristics of its predecessors to achieve superior performance.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Groups perform a final "dress rehearsal" of their presentation and robot demonstration, refining their arguments and ensuring their new prototype is ready for the final showcase.
