# Young Problem-Solvers: Robotics and Crafting Innovations üõ†Ô∏è

**Overarching Theme**: "Young Problem-Solvers: Exploring Problems and Creating Solutions with Tools"

This curriculum is designed for 5-year-old students (Year 1), following the Cambridge Primary curriculum and the 5E instructional model, with a focus on the K-2-ETS1-1 standard. The K-2-ETS1-1 standard emphasizes students learning to "Ask questions, make observations, and gather information about a situation people want to change to define a simple problem that can be solved through the development of a new or improved object or tool." It integrates foundational engineering design skills, computational thinking, and digital literacy as outlined in the Cambridge Primary Computing (0059) and Digital Literacy (0072) curricula. Robotics activities leverage the "Robotics Zone" (Yellow Area) and "Digital Workspace (Blue Area)" for hands-on experience in robotics, robot assembly, and programming.
