### **Years 10-13 STEAM Curriculum: Engineering Solutions for Global Challenges** üöÄ

#### **Curriculum Summary** üåü
This 15-class STEAM program offers advanced, project-based units for students in Years 10-13, aligning with the Cambridge Upper Secondary and Advanced pathways. The curriculum challenges students to select a project track that allows them to deepen their expertise in areas like advanced robotics, application development, complex 3D manufacturing, or AI systems integration.

The core of the curriculum is to address a major global challenge (**HS-ETS1-1**) by designing a solution to a complex real-world problem, breaking it down into smaller, manageable sub-problems (**HS-ETS1-2**). Students will heavily utilize computer simulations and digital models to predict the impact and performance of their solutions (**HS-ETS1-4**) and will rigorously evaluate their final prototypes based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs, considering a wide range of constraints (**HS-ETS1-3**).

**Global Challenge Context:** For this curriculum, students will focus on the global challenge of **Sustainable Urban Living**, addressing issues such as resource management, waste reduction, efficient transportation, or urban agriculture.

    *   **Explain**: Introduce **HS-ETS1-2**, which focuses on designing solutions to complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. Discuss system architecture and the importance of defining interfaces between components.
    *   **Elaborate**: Students break down their project into a detailed list of sub-problems and required modules. For each module, they define its inputs, outputs, and core function.
    *   **Evaluate**: Assess the students' system decomposition plans for logical structure and a clear understanding of how the smaller parts will integrate to solve the larger problem.
*   **Extension (30 min):**
    *   Students research existing technologies or APIs that could be used for one of their system's modules, evaluating their suitability.

#### **Class 3: Advanced Simulation and Predictive Modeling** üßä
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: "Before we spend weeks building a robot or an app, how can we use a computer to predict if our design will even work or how it will impact the wider system?"
    *   **Explore**: Using Python or specialized software, students build a simulation to model one critical aspect of their proposed solution. (e.g., a traffic flow model for a logistics app, a stress analysis simulation for a 3D-printed part).
    *   **Explain**: Introduce **HS-ETS1-4**, explaining how computer simulations are used to model the impact of proposed solutions, allowing for the testing of numerous criteria and constraints in a digital environment before physical prototyping.
    *   **Elaborate**: Students run their simulation under various conditions to generate predictive data. They must analyze this data to identify potential failure points, inefficiencies, or unintended consequences of their design.
    *   **Evaluate**: Review the students' simulation code and the data they generated. Provide feedback on the validity of their model and their analysis of its results.
*   **Extension (30 min):**
    *   Students use their simulation data to make a first-pass modification to their initial design, demonstrating an early iterative loop based on model predictions.
