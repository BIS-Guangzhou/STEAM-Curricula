### **Year 5 STEAM Curriculum: Advanced Robotics and Digital Innovation** üöÄ

#### **Curriculum Summary** üåü

This 15-class STEAM program is designed for Year 5 students within the Cambridge Lower Secondary framework, focusing on the NGSS standard **3-5-ETS1-3** ("Plan and carry out fair tests in which variables are controlled and failure points are considered to identify aspects of a model or prototype that can be improved"). Each 90-minute class, comprising a 60-minute main lesson and a 30-minute hands-on extension, follows the proven 5E instructional model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate) to foster deep learning and engagement.

Students will use laptops üíª, advanced robotics kits üöó, block-based coding platforms like **Code.org** and **Scratch**, and an introduction to text-based coding with **Python**. The curriculum includes dedicated units on 3D design and printing, allowing students to move from digital prototypes to physical objects. This program elevates their skills in computational thinking, programming, and digital literacy, preparing them for more complex, real-world challenges.

    *   **Evaluate**: Review the test plans for their clarity, logic, and understanding of controlled variables.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Students set up the physical environment for their planned "fair test." They mark start/finish lines, prepare the objects to be pushed, and ensure the testing surface is consistent, translating their written plan into a physical setup.
