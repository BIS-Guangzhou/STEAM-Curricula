### **Year 4 STEAM: Robotics & Creative Problem Solving** üöÄ

**Curriculum Summary** üåü
This 15-class STEAM program for Year 4 Cambridge Primary students focuses on NGSS standard **3-5-ETS1-2**, teaching them to generate and compare multiple solutions to problems. Each 90-minute session (60-minute main class + 30-minute robot extension ü§ñ) uses the 5E model to foster critical thinking and creativity. Students will use laptops, robotics kits, and platforms like Code.org to advance their coding skills and tackle more complex challenges. The curriculum emphasizes designing multiple solutions, comparing their effectiveness against set criteria, and justifying their design choices, preparing them for more advanced computational thinking.

#### **Unit 1: Foundations of Problem Solving & Coding Logic** üíª

##### **Class 1: From Instructions to Solutions** ü§ñ
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: Review the concept of an algorithm. Pose a simple problem: "How can we give a robot instructions to draw a square?"
    *   **Explore**: In groups, students brainstorm and draw at least two different step-by-step instruction sets (algorithms) to draw a square (e.g., one using only "move forward" and "turn right," another trying different turns).
    *   **Explain**: Discuss how different sets of instructions can achieve the same goal. Introduce the concepts of **criteria** (it must be a closed shape with four equal sides) and **constraints** (you can only use certain commands).
    *   **Elaborate**: Students write out their two different algorithms using pseudocode or simple written steps.
    *   **Evaluate**: Groups share one of their algorithms and explain why it meets the criteria.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Students use a block-based coding interface to program a robot to follow one of their "draw a square" algorithms. They will immediately see if their logic translates to a physical action, reinforcing the connection between algorithm and outcome.

##### **Class 2: Introduction to Loops and Efficiency** üß©
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: Show students a long, repetitive sequence of code blocks (e.g., move, turn, move, turn, move, turn, move, turn). Ask, "Is there an easier or shorter way to write this?".
    *   **Explore**: On Code.org, students complete puzzles that introduce the "repeat" or "loop" block. They will solve the same puzzle once without a loop, and then again using a loop.
    *   **Explain**: Explain that a **loop** is a way to repeat instructions, making code shorter and more efficient. Define "efficiency" as a new criterion for success.
    *   **Elaborate**: Students refactor their "draw a square" algorithm from the previous class to use a loop block.
    *   **Evaluate**: Students compare their old, long algorithm with their new, looped algorithm and explain which is more "efficient".
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Students program their physical robot to draw a square using a loop. They will then generate a new solution to draw a triangle or pentagon, comparing how changing the loop's parameters creates a different outcome.

##### **Class 3: Using Conditionals (If/Then)** üñ•Ô∏è
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: Pose a scenario: "What if you want your character to do something special *only if* it reaches a specific color or object?"
    *   **Explore**: Students work through Code.org puzzles that use conditional blocks like "if path ahead" or "if at flower" to make decisions.
    *   **Explain**: Introduce the concept of a **conditional** (if/then logic) as a way for a program to make decisions based on inputs or the environment.
    *   **Elaborate**: Students design a simple program where a character changes color or makes a sound *if* it touches the edge of the screen.
    *   **Evaluate**: Students explain the "if/then" rule they created in their program.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Using a robot with a color or distance sensor, students program it to perform an action (e.g., stop, make a sound) *if* it detects an object or a specific color mat on the floor. This provides a tangible example of conditional logic.

#### **Unit 2: Generating and Comparing Solutions** ü§ñ

##### **Class 4: Defining a Problem with Multiple Solutions** üõ†Ô∏è
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: Present a clear design problem: "Our robot needs to deliver a small object from Point A to Point B, but there is a wall between them."
    *   **Explore**: In groups, students brainstorm and sketch at least two different paths the robot could take: one going around the left of the wall, and one going around the right.
    *   **Explain**: Define the **criteria for success** (the object must arrive at Point B) and **constraints** (the robot cannot touch the wall). Explain that both sketched paths are valid potential solutions.
    *   **Elaborate**: Groups choose one of their sketched paths and write out the algorithm for it.
    *   **Evaluate**: Groups present their two path ideas, explaining how both could potentially solve the problem.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Groups set up the physical challenge on the floor with starting points, ending points, and an obstacle. They will program their robot to follow one of their proposed paths, testing its viability in the real world.

##### **Class 5: Coding and Testing Two Solutions** üñ±Ô∏è
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: "Yesterday, you planned two ways to solve the problem. Today, let's bring both to life!"
    *   **Explore**: Groups use laptops and robotics kits to code **both** of their proposed solutions (Path 1: Go Left; Path 2: Go Right) as two separate programs.
    *   **Explain**: Discuss the importance of testing each solution independently to see how well it works.
    *   **Elaborate**: Each group tests both of their programs, observing how the robot performs for each solution.
    *   **Evaluate**: Did both programs successfully solve the problem according to the criteria?
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Each group runs their two distinct robot solutions for another group. The observing group provides feedback, making this a peer-review and comparison activity.

##### **Class 6: Comparing Solutions and Debugging** üêû
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: Ask, "Even if both of your solutions worked, was one *better* than the other? Why?"
    *   **Explore**: Students are given a new criterion: **efficiency** (e.g., shortest time or shortest distance). They re-run their two solutions and collect simple data (e.g., time it with a stopwatch).
    *   **Explain**: Explain how to **compare solutions** based on data. If a solution failed, remind them of **debugging**‚Äîfinding and fixing the error to make it viable.
    *   **Elaborate**: Groups analyze their data and decide which of their two solutions is "better" based on the new efficiency criterion. They must justify their choice. If a program needs fixing, they debug it.
    *   **Evaluate**: Groups verbally present which solution they chose as the best and provide a reason based on their observations or data.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   A debugging challenge: The teacher provides a program that is supposed to navigate an obstacle but has one logical error. Students must find the error, fix it, and then propose and code a *second*, different solution to the same challenge.

##### **Class 7: Presenting Competing Designs** üìä
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: "Today, you are design engineers pitching your best solution!"
    *   **Explore**: Each group prepares a short presentation to the class. They must demonstrate both of their robot's solutions (the "runner-up" and the "winner").
    *   **Explain**: Explain that when comparing solutions, it's important to show the alternatives to justify why the chosen solution is the best one for the defined criteria and constraints (**3-5-ETS1-2**).
    *   **Elaborate**: Each group presents their two solutions and explains which one they think is better and why, referencing the criteria of success and efficiency.
    *   **Evaluate**: Assess students' ability to articulate their reasoning for selecting one solution over another, based on evidence.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   A "Robot Showdown" where two groups' "best" solutions are run simultaneously on identical courses. The class observes and discusses differences in performance, speed, and accuracy, further reinforcing the concept of comparing solutions.

#### **Unit 3: Iteration and Creative Problem Solving** üîß

##### **Class 8‚Äì11:**
These classes will follow a similar structure to the Year 3 curriculum's robotics challenge (e.g., "deliver a message across a lava pit"). However, the focus will be elevated to align with Year 4 objectives:
*   **Class 8 (Defining the Challenge):** Groups must define the problem and brainstorm at least **two different conceptual solutions** before sketching.
*   **Class 9 (Building & Initial Coding):** Groups will split their members to create initial code for **both** of their proposed solutions simultaneously.
*   **Class 10 (Testing & Improving):** The iterative design process will involve testing and debugging both solutions. A key decision point will be for the group to decide which solution shows more promise and is worth refining further.
*   **Class 11 (Presenting & Reflecting):** In their final presentation, groups must not only showcase their final, optimized robot but also explain the **second solution they decided to abandon**, justifying their decision based on test results, criteria, and constraints.

#### **Unit 4: Digital Creation & Collaboration** üé®

##### **Class 12: Digital Citizenship and Online Information** üåê
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: Pose a question: "If you search for 'robot facts' online, will every website give you the same information? How do you know which one to trust?"
    *   **Explore**: Students are given two pre-selected, kid-safe websites about a topic. They must find information and notice similarities and differences.
    *   **Explain**: Discuss why it's important to look at multiple sources and make **educated decisions about information encountered online**. Introduce the concept of being a "Knowledge Constructor".
    *   **Elaborate**: Students create a simple checklist for what makes a website seem trustworthy (e.g., "written by an expert," "looks professional").
    *   **Evaluate**: Students explain why it is important to check more than one website when looking for information.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   A "Robot Information Relay." The robot must visit two different "information stations" (e.g., colored mats) to collect two pieces of a puzzle. This physically represents the idea of gathering information from multiple sources to form a complete picture.

##### **Class 13: Creating with Digital Tools** ‚úçÔ∏è
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: "We've used code to solve problems. How can we use digital tools to share our ideas in a creative way?".
    *   **Explore**: Students use a simple digital presentation or drawing tool to create a visual representation of the two different solutions from their robotics challenge.
    *   **Explain**: Discuss how digital tools help us communicate complex ideas clearly. Introduce being a "Creative Communicator".
    *   **Elaborate**: Students create a two-slide presentation: Slide 1 shows their first solution, and Slide 2 shows their second solution, using drawings, shapes, and simple text.
    *   **Evaluate**: Assess the clarity of their digital artifact in representing their two different design ideas.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   "Robot as a Storyteller." Students program the robot to perform two different sets of movements, each representing a different part of a story or a different character, linking coding to creative expression.

##### **Class 14: Collaborative Digital Projects** üìΩÔ∏è
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: "How do teams work together on a single digital project?"
    *   **Explore**: Using a collaborative online tool (like a shared digital whiteboard or simple presentation software), groups work together to create a single poster summarizing their big robotics challenge project. Each member must contribute to a different section.
    *   **Explain**: Introduce the concept of being a "Global Collaborator," who can use digital tools to contribute constructively to a team project.
    *   **Elaborate**: Groups complete their collaborative digital poster, which must include a title, a description of the problem, and visuals of their two proposed solutions.
    *   **Evaluate**: Observe the group's collaboration and the final co-created digital artifact.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   "Collaborative Robot Programming." A single robot programming challenge where each student in the group is responsible for coding one part of the sequence. They must combine their code blocks in the right order to make the robot complete the full task, requiring effective communication and teamwork.

##### **Class 15: STEAM Innovation Showcase!** üéâ
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: Celebrate the end of the course with a showcase event.
    *   **Explore**: Groups present their final robot solution and their collaborative digital poster to an audience (classmates, other classes, or parents).
    *   **Explain**: Facilitate a reflection: "What was the most important thing you learned about creating and comparing different solutions to a problem?".
    *   **Elaborate**: Students reinforce their identity as **problem-solvers, computer scientists, and innovative designers** who understand that there is often more than one right way to solve a problem.
    *   **Evaluate**: Qualitative assessment based on the final presentation, the quality of the comparison between solutions, and student reflection, in line with Cambridge's emphasis on formative feedback.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   During the showcase, each group runs their final, optimized robot solution. Crucially, they must also show a video or run the code for their alternative solution, explaining to the audience why they made the design choices they did, directly addressing standard **3-5-ETS1-2**.
