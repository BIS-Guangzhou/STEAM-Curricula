## 3. Key Pedagogical Approaches & Principles üß†

Our curriculum employs research-backed instructional methods to maximize student learning and engagement, adhering to the Cambridge International Education's emphasis on teaching and learning.

*   **Hands-on and Project-Based Learning**: Students have ample opportunities to investigate, create programs, and directly interact with technology. This approach is proven to increase student engagement and problem-solving skills.
*   **Challenge-Based Learning (CBL)**: Students are engaged in solving **authentic, real-world problems** using STEM skills, channeling their interests and applying core educational knowledge. This framework was used to develop the K-12 STEM:IT Challenges.
*   **The 5E Instructional Model**: Each class is structured using the 5E model: **Engage**, **Explore**, **Explain**, **Elaborate**, and **Evaluate**.
*   **Iterative Design and Debugging**: Students are encouraged to test their solutions, observe failures, identify errors (debugging), make adjustments, and re-test, fostering **logical thinking** and an understanding that learning involves improvement.
*   **Cross-curricular Integration**: By integrating multiple subjects, including the arts, into challenges, we reinforce the importance of subject matter and demonstrate real-world applications. This approach is based on the whole-student approach to learning and influences long-term retention of complex subject knowledge.
*   **Formative Assessment**: In alignment with Cambridge Assessment's approach, assessment for Primary and Lower Secondary Computing and Digital Literacy subjects emphasizes **formative feedback**. Teachers provide feedback through discussion, observation, and lesson outputs, helping students reflect and improve their performance. There are **no formal Cambridge Progression Tests or Checkpoint Tests** for these subjects.
