# Shape Shapers: Designing Solutions with Robotics and Crafting üöÄ

## Curriculum Summary üåü

The "Shape Shapers: Designing Solutions with Robotics and Crafting" curriculum is a 15-class STEAM program designed for Year 2, Cambridge Primary üë©‚Äçüè´, aligning with the K-2-ETS1-2 standard, which emphasizes creating sketches ‚úçÔ∏è, drawings üé®, or physical models üõ†Ô∏è to show how an object's shape enables its function. Each 90-minute class (60-minute main activity + 30-minute robot-focused extension ü§ñ) engages students in hands-on, technology-integrated activities using a Digital Workspace (laptops üíª), Robotics Zone (robotics kits üöó), Manufacturing Station (craft materials ‚úÇÔ∏è), and 3D Printing Hub üñ®Ô∏è. Across four units, students progress from identifying shapes and their purposes to designing, building, and programming robot attachments, fostering skills in problem-solving üß†, creativity üé≠, and computational thinking üí°.

The curriculum begins with exploring basic shapes and their functions (Unit 1 üîç), advances to sketching functional designs (Unit 2 üìê), moves to crafting physical models (Unit 3 üß±), and culminates in solving complex challenges through integrated robotics and crafting (Unit 4 üöß). The robot extension activities reinforce concepts by having students interact with robots, such as attaching shaped components üîß or programming movements to test functionality ‚öôÔ∏è. By the final showcase üéâ, students present their creations, articulating how shapes solve specific problems, solidifying their identity as innovative designers üåà. This holistic approach ensures young learners connect shape, function, and technology in a fun, collaborative, and meaningful way üòä.
