##### **Year 9 STEAM Curriculum: Iterative Design and Smart System Modeling** üöÄ

###### **Curriculum Summary** üåü
This 15-class STEAM program is designed for Year 9 students, aligning with the Cambridge Upper Secondary framework and challenging them to apply their advanced skills in Python, AI, and systems engineering. The curriculum is centered on the NGSS standard **MS-ETS1-4**: **"Develop a model to generate data for iterative testing and modification of a proposed object, tool, or process such that an optimal design can be achieved"**. Each 90-minute class is structured with a 60-minute main lesson and a 30-minute hands-on extension, utilizing the 5E instructional model to foster deep learning and engagement.

Students will master their Python skills by creating models and simulations to predict system behavior before physical testing. They will learn to generate data from these models to drive an **iterative testing and modification** cycle, aiming for an optimal design. This year introduces a significant new hardware focus: students will use **microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators** to build and program a small "smart house," bridging the gap between digital simulation and real-world automated systems.

##### **Unit 1: Modeling, Simulation, and Advanced Programming (Classes 1-3)** üíª
###### **Class 1: Building a Digital Twin: Modeling a System in Python** üß©
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: Ask students, "Before building a multi-million dollar Mars rover, how do engineers test it? They can't just send it to Mars and see if it breaks." Introduce the concept of a "digital twin".
    *   **Explore**: Students will use Python's object-oriented principles to create a simple software model of their robot from Year 8. This "digital twin" will have variables representing its state (e.g., position, battery level) and methods to simulate actions (e.g., `move_forward(time)`) that update these variables.
    *   **Explain**: Formally introduce **MS-ETS1-4**, emphasizing the "develop a model" aspect. Explain that a simulation is a model that runs over time, allowing engineers to generate test data and predict how a system will behave under different conditions without needing a physical prototype for every test.
    *   **Elaborate**: Students create a simple simulation script that runs their digital twin through a series of commands and prints the resulting state (e.g., final position, remaining battery), generating the first set of model-based data.
    *   **Evaluate**: Review students' Python models for logical consistency and correct implementation of state variables and methods, providing formative feedback.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Students run their *physical* robot through the same sequence of commands they used in the simulation. They will manually record the robot's actual final position and compare it to the data generated by their digital model, noting any discrepancies.

###### **Class 2: Data-Driven Iteration: Modifying the Model** üåê
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: "Our simulation predicted the robot would end up here, but the real robot ended up over there. Why? And how can we make our model more accurate?"
    *   **Explore**: Students identify factors not accounted for in their initial model (e.g., wheel slippage, battery drain affecting speed). They will add a "friction_factor" or "power_decay" variable to their Python model and adjust it to better match the real-world data they collected.
    *   **Explain**: Discuss the core loop of **iterative testing and modification** as per **MS-ETS1-4**: use a model to generate data, compare with real-world tests, identify differences, and modify the model to improve its accuracy. This process is key to achieving an optimal design.
    *   **Elaborate**: Students run multiple simulations with different values for their new variables, trying to find the value that makes their model's output most closely match the real robot's performance. This demonstrates using a model to find an optimal parameter.
    *   **Evaluate**: Assess students' modified models and their process for using real-world data to refine their simulation's accuracy.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   With their newly calibrated model, students predict the outcome of a *new*, more complex maneuver. They then run the physical robot through this new test to see how well their improved model's prediction holds up, reinforcing the value of iteration.

###### **Class 3: Introduction to APIs and Data Exchange** üßä
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: "Our smart house will need to get the weather forecast to decide when to water the plants. How can our program talk to the internet to get that information?".
    *   **Explore**: Students will use Python to make a request to a free, public **API** (Application Programming Interface), such as a weather or time API. They will parse the returned JSON data to extract specific information (e.g., the current temperature).
    *   **Explain**: Explain that APIs are standardized ways for different software applications to communicate and exchange data. Discuss how this enables complex systems, from web apps to smart devices, to leverage external services and real-time information.
    *   **Elaborate**: Students write a program that calls an API and uses the retrieved data to make a decision (e.g., "IF weather condition is 'Rain', PRINT 'No need to water plants today.'"). This simulates the logic for their future smart house project.
    *   **Evaluate**: Review students' code to ensure they can successfully request, parse, and use data from a public API to trigger a logical action.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Students connect their robot's program to the API. The robot must perform a physical action based on the live data‚Äîfor example, doing a "sun dance" if the weather API reports "Clear" skies.

##### **Unit 2: Building an Automated System: The Smart House Project (Classes 4-7)** üè†
###### **Class 4: Introduction to Microcontrollers and Sensors** üéØ
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: Show a video of a smart home with automated lights, blinds, and climate control. Ask: "What is the 'brain' of this system, and how does it know what's happening in the environment?".
    *   **Explore**: Introduce the microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi Pico, Arduino) and a set of basic electronic components. Students will follow a guided tutorial to connect an LED to the microcontroller and run a simple "Blink" program written in Python or a similar language.
    *   **Explain**: Explain the difference between a general-purpose computer (like a laptop) and a **microcontroller** (a small computer on a single chip designed to control electronic systems). Introduce basic **sensors** (inputs, e.g., light sensor, temperature sensor) and **actuators** (outputs, e.g., LED, motor).
    *   **Elaborate**: Students connect a light sensor to their microcontroller. They write a program that reads the sensor's value and prints it to the screen, creating their first data-generating smart device.
    *   **Evaluate**: Observe students' ability to correctly wire a simple circuit and run code to read sensor data, providing formative feedback on safety and accuracy.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Students build a simple automated light system for their smart house model: the LED should turn on only when the light sensor detects that the room is dark.

###### **Class 5: Modeling the Smart House System** üìä
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: "Before we build a whole network of sensors in our house, let's create a model to test our logic and generate data to see how it will behave.".
    *   **Explore**: Students create a Python simulation of their smart house. The model will include variables for environmental conditions (e.g., `room_temperature`, `is_raining`) and the state of actuators (`light_is_on`). They will write functions to simulate sensor readings and actuator responses.
    *   **Explain**: Reinforce **MS-ETS1-4**. Explain that modeling is crucial for complex systems like this because it allows for rapid testing of logic ("what should happen if the temperature is 30¬∞C and it's raining?") without needing to build and rebuild the physical system.
    *   **Elaborate**: Students run their simulation with a pre-defined script of changing environmental conditions (e.g., day turns to night, a heatwave starts). Their model will generate a log file of the house's automated responses, providing data on its performance.
    *   **Evaluate**: Assess the logic of the students' smart house model and the data it generates, checking if the simulated responses to environmental changes are correct.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Students begin building the physical structure of their small model house, planning the placement of sensors and actuators they will install in the next class.

###### **Class 6: Integrating Multiple Sensors and Actuators** üìà
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: "A truly smart house doesn't just have one function. How do we get the temperature sensor, the light sensor, and the fan motor to all work together without interfering with each other?".
    *   **Explore**: Students will physically integrate multiple components into their model house: a temperature sensor, a light sensor, an LED (for lighting), and a small motor (for a fan). They will expand their microcontroller code to read from both sensors and control both actuators in a single, continuous loop.
    *   **Explain**: Discuss the challenges of managing multiple inputs and outputs in a real-time system. Explain how to structure code to handle different conditions and prevent conflicting commands, moving from simple `if` statements to more robust `if-elif-else` logic.
    *   **Elaborate**: Students program a set of integrated rules for their smart house, such as: "If it's dark, turn on the light. If it's hot, turn on the fan. If it's hot AND dark, do both." They test these rules with the physical hardware.
    *   **Evaluate**: Provide feedback on the students' code structure and their ability to successfully manage multiple hardware components simultaneously.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Students use their simulation from Class 5 to model the behavior of their integrated system. They compare the data generated by the model to the behavior of the physical house, identifying any differences in timing or logic to refine either their code or their model.

###### **Class 7: Optimizing the System through Iterative Testing** üêç
*   **Main Class (60 min):**
    *   **Engage**: "Our fan turns on at exactly 25¬∞C. Is that the *optimal* temperature? What if we could save energy by turning it on at 26¬∞C? How do we find the best setting?"
    *   **Explore**: Students will use their simulation model to run a series of tests. They will generate data for different temperature thresholds (e.g., 25¬∞C, 26¬∞C, 27¬∞C), calculating the "energy used" (fan on-time) and "comfort level" for each scenario based on a simulated 24-hour period.
    *   **Explain**: This class fully embodies **MS-ETS1-4**. Explain that by using a model to generate data for different parameters, they are performing **iterative testing and modification** to find an **optimal design**‚Äîin this case, the best balance between comfort and energy efficiency.
    *   **Elaborate**: Based on their simulation data, students choose what they believe is the optimal temperature threshold. They then implement this optimized setting in the code for their physical smart house and write a short justification for their choice, supported by their model's data.
    *   **Evaluate**: Assess the students' justification reports for their ability to use model-generated data to support their choice for an optimal system parameter.
*   **Robot Extension (30 min):**
    *   Students prepare their final, optimized smart house project for the showcase, ensuring all components are working and their code is clean and well-documented.
